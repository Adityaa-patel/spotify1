making a spotify analiser like stats fm but free and better?
it'll be a discord first and then maybe even a website

it aims to do more than stats.fm, once I'm done wiith core stuff like storing extracting and using data efficently i'll focus on visuallizing it with area graphs showing raise and fall of artists and even playlists

also i'll be using spotify api to record new data
